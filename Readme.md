### Built with

- JavaScript
- CSS 
- HTML5

### What I learned
A structured layout of the entire DOM was a challenge that I will be adding on to.
Using "Data-client" & "data-page" is a new way for me to grab data.


```
<section class="s2" data-client="Nevermind Keep Scrolling" data-page="2/4">
```

### Continued development
Using what I've learned I will do some more advanced things the next Repo commit.
